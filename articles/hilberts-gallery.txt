			<p>I have long had a fascination with randomness. Random processes that can end up producing order. Life itself 
			emerged by chance, out of randomness, evolving eventually to us. Many thought experiments have been prooposed around this idea. 
			Like the infinite monkeys, which by pressing keys randomly on typewriters will end up producing the entirety of Shakespear's work. 
			Fun fact this was attempted once by researches <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090318143423/http://www.vivaria.net/experiments/notes/publication/NOTES_EN.pdf">[1]</a>. The result was not any literary genius. The monkeys wrote nonsense, then smashed the keyboard 
			apart and urinated on it. Still... In theory it is possible. If you don't want it to be monkeys, it can be infinite computers producing 
			characters at random. Similarly, the <a href="https://libraryofbabel.info/">Library of Babel</a>, which at random produces 
			pictures and texts. Thus, by chance, all drawing, all pictures, all books, will be produced by this website eventually. 
			Naturally most of it is just noise. It would take you forever to find a meaningful image.</p>

			<p>With this, I want to introduce you to Hilbert's Gallery. After a lucrative hotel business, 
			Hilbert has now turnt his attention to the art world. The gallery can hold an infinite amount of paintings. 
			It already does contain an infinite amount of paintings. There is still space for an infinite more. 
			Unlke the artworks of Babel, Hilbert's are a lot more coherent (a product of a GAN rather than an algorithm). 
			Most are still very abstract. One should approach the gallery with the same mindset that a young child has 
			when looking for shapes in the clouds.</p>

			<p>So go ahead and explore the infinite gallery!</p>

			<h3>Curated Works</h3>
			<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
			<p>Here I have selected a few works that popped up, which I think looked pretty good. If you also find any interesting ones, feel free to 
			send them to me.</p>
			<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
			<img class="img-fluid" src="/imgs/art1.jpeg" style="width: 30%" />
			<p>First we have "by the canal", artist unknown. </p>
			<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
			<img class="img-fluid" src="/imgs/art2.jpeg" style="width: 30%" />
			<p>Next is the "fields at home", artist unknown. </p>
			<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
			<img class="img-fluid" src="/imgs/art3.jpeg" style="width: 30%" />
			<p>And finally we have my personal favourite "landscape", artist unknown. </p>
			<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
			<img class="img-fluid" src="/imgs/kiss.png" style="width: 30%" />
			<p>We also have "the kiss", artist unknown, pixels on screen.</p>
			<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
			<h3>Ethics</h3>
			<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
			<p>I know the whole debate about AI-generated art. I want to say that this project does not suffer from the same problems. 
			First, all work produced is random. Users have no control over what is generated. Second... It's pretty bad.</p>
