	<p>Hashing is the process of translating an input of arbitrary length to a fixed length digest (though some modern
		functions
		like SHA-3 can create variable-length digets). To keep it simple we will focus only on the fix-length case.
		Mathematically a hash
		function is: </p>
	<div class="row .me-5">
		<div class="col-xs-1 col-md-1"></div>
		<div class="col-xs-10 col-md-10"><b>h: {0,1}<sup>*</sup> => {0,1}<sup>n</sup></b></div>
		<div class="col-xs-1 col-md-1"></div>
	</div>
	<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
	<p>What does this mean? Well if we have a binary input (since everything is binary in computer), which is the {0,1}
		part,
		regardless of its size, the <sup>*</sup>, we want to create a binary output which will always be of length n,
		{0,1}<sup>n</sup>.
		That way regardless if you have the single digit '8', a short text, or a vide that is several GBs in size, the
		function will give you
		an output always of length n-bits. For example, if you used SHA-256, all inputs (including the above three) will
		give you
		a digest of 256 bits (0s or 1s). You can try playing around with SHA-256 below: </p>

	<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
	<p>One thing to remember is that hashing <b>DOES NOT</b> produce a unique result. It is possible that file A and
		file B produce the
		same digest. This stems out of the simple fact that the input space is much larger than the output one.
		Try to enumerate all numbers with only n numbers. Regardless of how large n is, there will always be a number
		(n+1) which needs
		to be mapped to somewhere between 1 and n, where another number already has been mapped to. When a hash function
		produces the same value for two different inputs, we say we have a collision</p>
	<div class="row .me-5">
		<div class="col-xs-1 col-md-1"></div>
		<div class="col-xs-10 col-md-10"><b>collision: A != B and h(A) = h(B)</b></div>
		<div class="col-xs-1 col-md-1"></div>
	</div>
	<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
	<p>Collisions are unavoidable. Depending on your application they can really break everything. Usually we want the
		probability of finding a
		collision to be low enough that we dont need to worry about it too much (for example 1 in 2<sup>n/2</sup>).</p>

	<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
	<h3>Hash Function Applications</h3>
	<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
	<p>There are <i>toooooo</i> many applications of hash functions to exhaustively explain. It is a simple idea that
		sees great utility
		in many systems and fields. Here I will focus on the main ones (the rest can be derived from these): </p>
	<ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
		<li><b>Indexing</b> - since hash functions produce fixed-length results they are used in a lot of structures
			(databases, hashtables, etc) to
			efficiently store and retrieve elements. Consider a hash table of size m (where m cannot be larger than
			2<sup>n</sup>). When a new element needs to be added
			(for example a new profile to facebook, based on username), you calculate the hash, then take it modulo m
			(so it is between 0 to m-1), which gives you some number index (or its identifier).
			Then you store this profile, its likes, any comments, etc. at location index in your system (for example on
			the index-th memory location).
			When someone wants to retrieve information about this profile, you calculate the hash modulo m (of the
			username), to get index again, and retrieve it from location index.
			What happens when there is a collision? Well, you store it in a "bucket" (list of elements). Then when you
			get a profile with some index, you check the
			index-th bucket and traverse all elements in the list to find the one that is with the same username. This
			is significantly faster than each time checking ALL profiles
			you have stored. You only need to calculate the hash (and then potentially check a small number of elements
			with the same hash value). </li>
		<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
		<li><b>Comparison</b> - some algorithms use hashing to compare large elements in a quick and efficient manner.
			That way one needs to compute the hash
			only once and then compare it with other hashes (rather than each time going through the entire large object
			to compare each bit with another large one).
			This does not guarantee that two elements are the same (as collision exist). Still it gives you a high
			proability that the two elements are the same.
			Locality-Prserving Hashing functions extend this functionality even further <a
				href="https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/meijincheng/pdf/Locality%20Preserving%20Hashing.pdf">[1]</a>.
			With LPH if A is more similar to B than C (given some metric), then the hashes of h(A) and h(B) should be
			closer than those of h(A) and h(C) or h(B) and h(C).
			This sees use in plagirism detection (if someone stole your image and slightly modified it). </li>
		<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
		<li><b>Password Authentication</b> - very similar to the previous point. Normally when logging in, instead of
			sending your password to the server
			and risking it being stolen, you would send a hash of it. Then the server merely compare it to the hash it
			has stored of it. If they match you get access.
			This ensures some security as, given a hash, it is difficult to invert it to find what the original was.
			Here it is best to use Cryptographic Hash Functions (see below),
			which unlike LPH, should create vastly different digests for two similar inputs.</li>
		<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
		<li><b>Error Detection</b> - you can transmit a message in conjunction with its hash. When the recipient
			receives the message, they
			calculate the hash and compare it to the one you have sent. If there is a mismatch, there was an error in
			transmission (whether in the hash or the message sent).
			One can build on top of this with Keyed-Hashing functions. They are essentially hashing functions mixed with
			<a href="/article/symmetric-key-cryptography">symmetric-key cryptography</a>.
			This way when one sends the "encrypted" hash (message authentication code), it is guaranteed to some extend
			that the message has not been modified
			(as an attacker would need to break the key to modify the message). Let us examine this a bit further.
			Consider Bob sending to Alice the message "I love you".
			Bob and Alice have a secret key shared between them "942". Bob then calculates the keyed-hash of the message
			and sends it to Alice. Upon receiving,
			Alice calculates the keyed-hash of the message and checks it against the sent one. If there is a mismatch
			someone has modified the message (or there was an error).
			If Eve wants to modify the message to "I don't love you", she needs the secret key to compute a new valid
			message authentication code, as otherwise
			Alice will not trust the message. It is still possible to contruct two different messages whit same
			keyed-hash! You can play around with HMAC (a type of keyed cryptographic function), below:</li>

	<h3>The Birthday Paradox</h3>
	<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
	<p>Did you know that the chance for at least 2 people to have the same birthday in a group of 23 people is about
		50%? Why? Well, let us look at the math: </p>
	<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
	<p>In a year there are 365 (366 on a leap year, but it won't affect the conclusion). Let us try to construct a group
		of 23 such that <i>THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT BIRTHDAYS</i>.
		This is the opposite case of the one we state above. Since probabilities always sum to 1, we will know that:
	</p>
	<div class="row .me-5">
		<div class="col-xs-1 col-md-1"></div>
		<div class="col-xs-10 col-md-10"><b>P(same birthday of at least 2 people) = 1 - P(all different birthdays)</b>
		</div>
		<div class="col-xs-1 col-md-1"></div>
	</div>
	<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
	<p>Where P(_) denotes the probability of a given event. So in our group of 23 people, the first person we consider
		(doesn't matter what is the order) can be born on any of the 365 days.
		Since they are the first person we don't need to worry about collisions yet. The second person can be born on
		any day EXCEPT the one that person is born on.
		This leaves them with 364 days to be born on. Since there are 365 days in a year, the probability of someone
		being born on any 364 days is 364/365.
		The third person can be born on any of the days except the days of person 1 and 2 (since we are trying to have
		no collisions). This leaves them with 363 days.
		The probability of that is 363/365. This goes on and on, until we have: </p>
	<div class="row .me-5">
		<div class="col-xs-1 col-md-1"></div>
		<div class="col-xs-10 col-md-10"><b>P(all different) = <sup>365</sup>&frasl;<sub>365</sub> *
				<sup>364</sup>&frasl;<sub>365</sub>
				* <sup>363</sup>&frasl;<sub>365</sub> * <sup>362</sup>&frasl;<sub>365</sub> *
				<sup>361</sup>&frasl;<sub>365</sub> * <sup>360</sup>&frasl;<sub>365</sub> ... </b>

			<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
			<b>P(all different) = 0.4920....</b>
			<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
			<b>P(same birthday of at least 2 people) = 1 - 0.4920..</b>
			<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
			<b>P(same birthday of at least 2 people) = 0.5079...</b>
		</div>
		<div class="col-xs-1 col-md-1">
		</div>
	</div>
	<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
	<p>So what does this mean? If you take a random group of 23 people 100 times, you should expect about 50 of those
		times to have at least 2 people with the
		same birthday. Of course in reality the results are slightly skewed in favour of the paradox, as people aren't
		born with uniform probability across the year
		(on some days more children are born than on others, for... various reasons). </p>
	<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
	<p>For our context this means that if a hash function has an output space of n bits (2<sup>n</sup> possible hash
		values), we need to only consider
		slightly more than 2<sup>n/2</sup> values to find a collision about half the times. We also want to find <i>a
			meaningful collision</i>, as it is always possible to find
		a collision. For example it is possible that the messages: "I love you" and "42if02 cjnf29na nf2ifn" have the
		same hash values. But sending the latter message,
		even with the same hash, would be meaningless to Alice. So what Eve does is takes a message she wants to send
		("I don't love you") with a valid hash to Alice, and
		finds 2<sup>n/2</sup> small modifications she can introduce that won't change the message (e.g. adding an extra
		space between two words, sligthly misspelling, them etc).
		Eve then calculates the hash for all those messages hoping to find a collision. This is called a "Birthday
		Attack".</p>
	<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
	<p>If Bob has used a cryptographically secure hash algorithm with large enough output space (for example SHA-256),
		Eve will need to check an incredibly
		high amount of modifications. For SHA-256 it is 2<sup>128</sup>, which is too high for any computer to compute
		in the next 100s of years. This is of course
		without the use of specialised algorithms, but even then the search time will be too high to be reasonable.</p>

	<h3>Cryptographic Hash Functions</h3>
	<p>There isn't much to add to what has already been said about hash functions. Cryptographic Hash Functions are not
		<i>particularly</i> special, but rather they exemplify the qualities of hash functions.
		Cryptographic Hash Functions must provide the following guarantees (notice that they are not keyed - as in no
		key is used for the digest generation unlike in the keyed-hash functions): </p>
	<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
	<div class="row .me-5">
		<div class="col-xs-1 col-md-1"></div>
		<div class="col-xs-10 col-md-10">
			<ol>
				<li>All outputs are equally likely</li>
				<li>Small changes in the input should result in great changes in the output (it should behave almost
					pseudo randomly)</li>
				<li>Finding <b>any</b> two inputs that are different with the same hash value should be infeasible (take
					too much time)</li>
				<li>It should be infeasible to "invert" the function, i.e. given a hash value, find the input that
					produced such output</li>
				<li>It should be infeasible to given a hash value, find an input which produces it</li>
				<li>It should be deterministic - one input must always produce same output</li>
			</ol>

	<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
	<p>Some (and the most important ones) cryptographically secure hash functions are SHA-2, SHA-3, and Whirpool.</p>
